C++ code to solve Huffman question: input a sentence then print a huffman list and code.

example:

Please input your sentence:

Here is your HuffmanCode list:
No Char  Freq   Huffmancode
 1    h     1           000
 2    e     1           001
 3    l     3            10
 4    o     2           110
 5          1           010
 6    w     1           011
 7    r     1          1110
 8    d     1          1111

Here is your HuffmanCode:
00000110101100100111101110101111
